# create-data-harmonizer

Scaffold a [DataHarmonizer](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer) project from a [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) schema.

## Requirements 

This script and the project it generates both require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 14+.

## Usage

It is recommended that you run one of the following commands in the directory where you want the new project directory to be created.

With NPM (version 6.1+):

```shell
npm init data-harmonizer <schema file>
```

With Yarn:

```shell
yarn create data-harmonizer <schema file>
```

The script will parse your schema and ask you a few questions about what to generate. Once it is finished you will see instructions on how to get started with your new project.
